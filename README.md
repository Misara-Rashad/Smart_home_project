# Smart_home_project
this project includes 2 ATMEGA32 MCUs one is a master and the other is a slave 
#the master MCU has :
  1.security system with LCD and Keypad
  2.can communicate with slave and get status of each load in any room using SPI 
  3.can control loads that is connected to the slave MCU using SPI

#the slave MCU has :
  1.three relay loads
  2.two dimmers circuits
  3.one AC with a temperature sensor
  4.door control
